# Relevel-Backend-Cohort January 7 Assignment 2- TODO App

Created a new TODO App which has an input field to add tasks. It has 2 different lists - “To be Done” and “Completed” List
When user enter task in the input field, it is added to the “To Be Done” list
When a user clicks on the “Mark as Done” button on a task present in the “To Be Done” list, it should get added to the “Completed” list and removed from the “To Be Done” list.
