# Relevel-Backend-Cohort January 7 Assignment 2- TODO App

Create a new TODO App which will have an input field to add tasks. We will have 2 different lists - “To be Done” and “Completed” List
When user enter task in the input field, it should be added to “To Be Done” list
When a user clicks on the “Mark as Done” button on a task present in the “To Be Done” list, it should get added to the “Completed” list and removed from the “To Be Done” list.
